Inspired by [a great tutorial](http://nesdoug.com/) on programming NES games in C using [cc65](http://cc65.github.io/cc65/) and a deep dive down the rabbit hole of the excellent [NES Dev Wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com/), I decided to write my own tutorial.
In an effort to learn all that I can about NES development and to inspire others to make great games for me to play, I will aim to err on the side of too much information.

This tutorial and all of the code therein is available on [Github]({{ site.github_url }}) under the [MIT License](https://github.com/cirla/nesdev/blob/master/LICENSE).
Please do fork and submit a pull request or [create an issue]({{ "/issues" | prepend: site.github_url }}) if you notice anything is incorrect or otherwise lacking.
